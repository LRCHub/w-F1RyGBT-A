When we go for a little walk,
Out on the land,
When we're just walkin' and holdin' hands,

You can take it as a sign of love,
When the winds of fate,
Keep blowin' and we both understand,

Sign of love
It's a sign of love
Sign of love
Sign of love

When we both have silver hair,
And a little less time,
But there still are roses on the vine,

You can take it as a sign of love,
When I look at you,

When I'm lookin' at you for a long, long time

It's a sign of love,
A sign of love,
Sign of love,

Sign of love

When I first saw you,
You were just a girl,
And I was a man,
While the music played,
I watched you dance,

Sign of love
It was a sign of love
Sign of love
Sign of love
Sign of love
